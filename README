This is an alternative implementation of the su binary for Superuser on Android.
This implementation is compatible with the original su binary but differs in
the following:
o it doesn't use the am command for notifying Superuser
o it sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the value copied from the parent process
  on ICS or higher
o it is linked dynamically

The implementation is compatible with Superuser 3.0.7 or less.
